# AISTR Docker
This repository contains a Dockerfile and a shell script that are used to build the Docker container for the course AISTR (Artificial Intelligence for Software Testing and Reverse Engineering - CS4110). The shell script is only used to install KLEE on the docker container. The shell script can be used separately and it isn't linked to the Dockerfile.
